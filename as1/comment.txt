/* ===================================== Commentary ======================================= */

The find2perl command uses the File::Find Perl method to search the directory the find command
would have been executed in.  The generated Perl code includes two subroutines: `wanted` and 
`doexec'.  The former consists of a translation of the filters (e.g., '-name ...') to a chain
of Boolean tests.  '-name' is translated to a regex test; '-size' translates to a pair, the
first of which extracts generic info on the file object, and the second tests specifically the
value of the size property, after converting it to an int type.  At the end of the chain of 
Boolean tests is a call to the `doexec` subroutine, which executes the `ls -l` command and
prints the result.

This utility would be useful for saving common operations as on-demand executable scripts.
Another application would be a quick and dirty way of generating specific subroutines in a 
larger Perl script you are writing, especially if you already know how to carry out the
operation via `find`.
